# BasketballAnalysis

An Analysis on the Game of Basketball by: Tajinder Uppal, Arun Yadav, and Brian Mendonca

Under the guidance of Professor Yi Ren

The goal of this project was to analyze the game of basketball at the Sun Devil Fitness Center.
The team did this by recording basketball games at the SDFC courts and using hypothesis testing.

The team proposed various hypotheses to test such as:

● Do particular races shoot better percentages? 
● Do particular courts at the SDFC shoot better percentages? 
● Do winning teams shoot more 3 pointers? 
● Do winning teams make more 3 pointers? 
● Do different races have different playing styles?
● Do different courts have different playing styles? 

To answer the questions proposed, the team utilized a number of hypothesis tests, sometimes using the built in Excel function T.TEST.
